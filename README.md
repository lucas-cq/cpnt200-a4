## Usage
The navigation works! Articles will display the list of articles, and gallery will display the list of cars.

## Code Review
This was fun, when javascript starts working its always fun tinkering with it. My biggest challenge was making everything link together, but that got figured. Another thing I learned was I couldnt link the image with src="{{ post.image }}". I had to use :src="post.image", thanks to my terminal for telling me.

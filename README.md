## Code Review
This was fun setting up, and finishing. My liking for tailwind is growing along with vue. I'm thinking of doing my final assignment on vue, because everything about it just makes sense. No matter what Tony says /s. I preffered mustache syntax over v-html, but i'm sure that would change with different circumstances. v-for was interesting to work with and i'm still figuring out how it works.
